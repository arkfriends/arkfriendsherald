This is software for operating a low cost multi-purpose e-signage
solution driven as the primary display of a dedicated Windows XP box.

There are 3 controllers to this system:
1) Database interface: allows privileged users to identify content,
   type, priority, duration, and location of news items to be displayed.
2) Scheduler: combs the database looking for valid content ready for display
   and develops the hot list for the content being queued
3) Viewer: reads the hot list, calls the appropriate display service to
   display the next item and closes the display when the item show is over.

Supports news items developed in Powerpoint, HTML, RSS, PDF, JPG, GIF, TXT
